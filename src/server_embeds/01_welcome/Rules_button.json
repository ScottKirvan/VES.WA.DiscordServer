      "description": "**1. Be nice**  \nTreat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.\n\n**2. Don't spam**\nNo spam or self-promotion (advertisements, server invites, etc.) in the server's channels, member DMs, and nicknames. When it's appropriate within the conversation, exceptions will be made. Though, that doesn't mean it should be the primary goal of the conversation.\n\n**3. Keep content appropriate**  \nDo not post NSFW or obscene content of any kind, this includes but is not limited to nudity, sex, violence, or otherwise disturbing content.\n\nThis rule applies to text, images, videos, audio, links, your username, avatar, and status.\n\n**4. Code of Conduct**\nMembers are expected to abide by the VES Code of Conduct  (https://www.vesglobal.org/visual-effects-society-code-of-conduct/).\n\n**5. Discord Requirements**\nWe follow the Discord Community Guidelines (https://discordapp.com/guidelines). Any violation against them or the discord TOS (https://discordapp.com/terms) will be result in an instant ban. \n\n**6. Foreign languages**\nUnless explicitly allowed in a channel, all communication is expected to be English-only. We hope to have multi-lingual mods to help facilitate additional languages in the future.\n\n**7. Reporting violations**\nIf you need to report someone for violating the rules, please do so through the #help-and-support channel - Thank you!\n\n**8. Common sense**\nAll moderator decisions are final and cannot be argued with.  Just practice common sense and there shouldn't be any issues.  Our focus is on running a healthy, fun, and empowering server - thank you for your cooperation and assistance :-)",
